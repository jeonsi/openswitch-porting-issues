# front panel led mismatch
- When I link up port 1, there is no led turned on.
- When I link up port 2, led marked number 1 is turned on.
- When I link up port 3, led marked number 2 is turned on.
...

# some front panel leds are always turned on, even though there is no optic module inserted.
- Led marked number 36 is always turned on as amber color.
- Led marked number 53-4 is always turned on as green color.

# Workaround
- It's cosmetic error.
- Ports works OK. Ignore the LED order.

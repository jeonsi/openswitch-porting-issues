# When I save the configuration as below, it hangs.

```
copy running-config startup-config
[prompt never shows up]
```

- Just after installation, when I save the configuration at first time, it works normally.
- But from the second initiation of the above command, CLI prompt does not show up for quite long time, for example, more than 10 minutes.
- During that period, if I ssh to the switch on another terminal, I can access the switch normally.
